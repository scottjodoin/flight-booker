# Flight-Booker

A simple rails 5 project made with the purpose of using seeds, nested forms, and custom params.

Search for a flight with how many people you would like on that flight, and then book it!

### TODO (may save this for another project)

* pagination for lots of results

*  make it prettier

* mailer functionality
